- The canvas on Service Graph may zoom and pan unexpectedly when modifying Views or Layers
- Dragging tiers to modify their order is currently not working in the UI, though you can still change its order when editing a tier

- Installing {{prodname}} on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.13 with the eBPF dataplane is currently not working
- Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.17.1 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed.
- Multi-cluster management of managed clusters with version < v3.17.0 is currently not working.
